Long had we scanned the heavens with our telescopes, and searched our Solar System with probes, finding nothing but the most circumstatial evidence of alien life. However, as time wore on, we began to find anomolous things: supernova reamnents from stars far too young to have died naturally, regions of space more sparsely populated than expected, planets with anomolous compositions, among other things. By themselves, any of these events could have been explained away as a statistacle anomoly. Taken as a whole, they suggested that some of our ideas about how the universe worked were fundemetally flawed.]],

We began finding the remnents of mega-structures, the oldest at least 4.5 billion years old, and the youngest dating to about 3.7 billion years ago. Taken together with the anomolies that had long puzzled astronomers, the puzzle began to unravel. We theorize that around 4.5 billion years ago, the first galactic civilizations, the Precursors, began to arise. For a time there was a period of peacful interaction, lasting perhaps 200 million years. But this peace was not to last, and a vast war broke out, perhaps over resources, or perhaps for ideological reasons. What ever the case, the war lasted longer that most of the species participating in it, and began to wind down, with the last of the hostilities ending around 3.5 billion years ago. We call this conflict the Dawn War.]],

As near as we can tell, not a single species survived for for that a few million years after the Dawn War. There is evidence of some later cultures, but they do not appear to be related to the Precursors. Across the imensity of space of time, it is difficult to acertain anything about the Precursors. Hopefully we will continue to learn more in the future.]],
