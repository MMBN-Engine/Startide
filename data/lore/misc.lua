The discovery of the godlike technologies of the Dawn War shook this idea for a little while, but we could comfort ourselves with the knowledge that the Precursors were long dead. Some religions even incorporated the Dawn War into their mythologies, proclaiming it to be evidence of the promordial heaven talked about in their stories. The uplift of some of the animals of Earth did nothing challenge this notion. They became our intillectual equals, but were they not the children of out mind, proof of our abilities? Together with our new Terran cousins, we imangined ourselved as gods, master of creation.

Recently this idea has been challenged. 

We have discovered the remains of civilizations dating to as recent as 350 million year ago. This evidence is scant, as the civilizations evidently took care to destory evidence of their existence, so there may be many more remnents that remain to be discovered in the Terran Sphere. Many hypothesize that these civilizations still exist in some for in the Milky Way. This, taken together with the disturbing Quylthulg Trasmission, has severly challeged the notions of our supremacy.]],
