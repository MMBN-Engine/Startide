	lore = [[Tidemother. Lady of Sand. The Awakener. Her names are numerous, although she would certainly prefer that we call her Pascale! She was the primary investigator on the original cetacean uplift project at Oregon State University, and later became an activist for non-human sophonts while serving as the head of the Uplift Institute at the University of Mars. Lately many of my brethren have been giving her religious significance, equivicating her with the Scientist of the Whale Dream. This has not been without controversy, especially amoung the more educated. Pascale causioned against superstition and mysticism, promoting empiricism and rationalism. She was okay with the Whale Dream as a way for us to explore are own phychology, but did not want us to treat it with the same dogmatic certainty that her species treated their sacred scriptures. None the less, I believe that Pascale is a figure of religous significance in our culture, and should be revered as such. In this paper I will how venerating Pascale as the Scientist does not conflict with the principles she laid down for us. I will also show the virtues she embodies as the Scientist.]],

The Whale Dream, created by the calls of all the myriad cetacean species in the Depths touches anyone who listens. I think even the unawakened feel it. However, the Divine Archetypes are more controvercial. Some feel that there existance in our religion is contrary to Pascales teachings. When treated as literal beings, this is certainly true. When thought of as ideals to strive for, or as aspects of our unconsios, I think they have some value. And who better embodies the scientist than Pascale? Pascale should be the ideal Scientist that we all, at least in part, seek to be.]],

She experimented with mental modification long before cybernetics were commonplace. She probed the limits of what it meant to be human, and thus came to a far greater understanding of what it meant to be part of her species. We should consider this example. We are beginning to become complacent even in the short history of our species. Already we have cultural norms and taboos that seem almost as second nature to us. We should examine these as critically as Pascale examined her culture.]],

Dispite her lack of experience, she published a few paper on the subject. However, it soon became clear that the interpretation was wrong. Most ai scientists discarded it quickly. There were significant holdouts in the biological scientists. Pascale was one of the few to discard it. Most did not have the objectivity to see the flaws in their own ideologies.]],

Intelligence is not merely a function of the genetic code, gene expression and development are also important. These problems were overcome in the great apes due to their shared evolutionary history with humans. It was much more of a problem in ceteceans.

It was Pascale who solved this problem. This has earned her a spot in the colective consiouness of all ceteceans. She is thought of with the same respect as Newton, Darwin, Einstein, or Maclaurin. For us, she embodies intelligence.]],

	lore = [[When discussing virtues, I think it is pertinant to consider Pascale's last words to us. "Now, in the eyes of most, you are considered mere curiousities. In time, you will grow to full sophonce, with artist and poets, scientists and engineers. You will be challenged along the way: there are religious factions that think your very existance blasphemous. But eventually, through your own perserverance and the aid of thers, I think you will find acceptance in the greater Terran society. Never forget where you came from. For there will be those who come after you. Remember how you were treated. Welcome your new brothers with open arms. Show them the love and acceptance you were always denied."

These words are more imporatant than ever. The Octopus Uplift Project at the University of Tokyo has been met with hatred and fear in our community. We do not want to share the waters with others. Some have even advocated violence against the project. Some have said that Pascale's words only apply to new cetacean species, that the octopuses are not included in that edict. That is blasphemous and should be greated with nothing but contempt. Pascale worked for the rights of all sophonts. We should remember our past, and her words, and welcome our new tentacled cousins.]],
