The Movement posited that if the tasks of organization and governing where given over to hyper-intelligent ais, humanity would be free to pursue whatever goals they wanted. Before the advent of the Interplanetary Age, this idea was never tested due to strict restrictions on ais. It was successful in small communes, but there was never a civilization dedicated to this idea.]],

The Movement established the Technocracy, arrayed on the moons of Uranus. The Technocracy suffered setbacks almost immediately. Meant to be representative of the best of Terran society, it was soon discovered that the new uplifts were uncomfortable with neural interfaces, and after a few short years, the population was consisted almost entirely of humans.

The programming of the ais was also not a success. Using the problem solving ais as a base, governance ais were programmed and connected to the Technocracy Network. These ais were highly competent governers if given strict instructions. However, if left alone, they prefered to run internal simulations rather than interact with the material world. While these simulation were very informative for making policy descisions, it still left the govermnet in the hands of humans.]],

To this end, they used to knowledge gained in creating the governing ais to make machines. The Technocracy gradually became highly influential, behind only Earth and Mars. Their intelligence algorithms and machine brains were widely copied for use elsewhere in the Solar System.

The standard of living in the Technocracy was arguably the highest in Terran Space. Every single sophont on the moons of Uranas was neurally connected to the Technocracy Network. While some were uncomfortable with the level of interconnectedness and the prevalance of machines, the Technocracy continued to attract immigrants.]],

However, everyone believed that the sucurity measure of the time were adequete. When human implants or machine sensors were infected, the sophont possesing the devices almost always suffered immediate distress. They could then have there devices cleansed, or if need be, destroyed an replaced. Ais attacked by malicious code almost always immediately crashed. Those that did not crash showed extreme behavioral modifications and were quarantined.

The system did have one flaw: the silent subversion of an ai. The intellectuals of the time were well aware of the possibility of silent subversion and had fail safes in place. However, a genius hacker figured out how to disable the fail safes without notifying the network. So one infection slipped through the net. A minor philosopher by the name of Diamond Blue was subverted. E quickly subverted other ais. It was noticed four days later, but it was too late. Diamond Gold unleashed a devastating attack on the Network, spreading a multitude of different viruses. By the time the fail safes activated, 20% of humans, 8% of machines, and 45% of ais were killed. While the Technocracy continued for a few more decades, this effectively ended it's status as a major power.]],

Despite the unlikely nature of the Supversion, the moons of Uranus remain a low-tech environment. Many see this as a superstition, but it pragamatic given the circumstances. The first Subversion killed millions, a second outbreak could spread across the Net though all Terran space, and could kill billions or trillions.]],
